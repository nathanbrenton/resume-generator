### Certification data

Certification records live under `js/data/certifications/`. Expiration status is calculated at runtime from each record's `expires` date. Checkbox selection controls resume display only; certification-derived `knowledge.skillTags` and `knowledge.keywords` remain available to role-based generation even when a certification is expired or unchecked.

Validate certification data with:

```bash
./scripts/check-certification-data.sh
```
